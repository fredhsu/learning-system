## Random Variable

A random variable is a function from outcomes to numbers — like a lookup table that converts random outcomes into numerical values so we can do math with them.

## Probability Mass Function (PMF)

Gives the probability of the outcomes for a discrete random variable, as in a lookup table. Gives an exact value.

ex. for a d6: $P(X=3) = 1/6$

## Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

Gives the running total up to a value / probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a value.

ex: for a d6: $P(X < 3) = P(1) + P(2) + P(3) = 3/6 = 0.5$
