# Operations for AVD network services

## Goal

Allow linking between the different cards by their Zettle ID number

- The current 'Linked Cards' field in the note creation/edit form is not functional
- The linked cards field should allow for input of zero or more Zettle ID numbers
- The linked Zettle IDs should be shown when viewing the card, and should be links that will allow the user to click and go to the linked card

## Steps

1. Begin with planning how changes will work.
2. Create unit tests for the new functions.
3. Get user verification that the changes look good
4. Write code to implement the goals and functionality given above
5. Ensure all tests pass
